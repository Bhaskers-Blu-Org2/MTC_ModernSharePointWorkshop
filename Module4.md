# Module 4 - Hub Sites

SharePoint hub sites help you meet the needs of your organization by connecting and organizing sites based on project, department, division, region, etc. making it easier to:

- discover related content such as news and other site activities,
- apply common navigation and branding across associated sites,
- search across all associated sites.

In this module, you will create a hub site and associate another site with it. You will also explore some of the benefits of this relationship such as navigation, news, search, and branding.
