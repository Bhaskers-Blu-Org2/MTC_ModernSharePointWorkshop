# Module 2 - Site Themes and Branding

Most intranet deployments involve some sort of requirement for the appearance of the sites and pages to be consistent with your company's brand.

In this module, you will learn about how to theme the Office 365 experience including the top nav bar and logo. You will explore site specific controls like site logos, navigation, and the provided site themes. Lastly, you will use the Theme Generator tool to develop your own custom theme and through PowerShell deploy it to the tenant.
